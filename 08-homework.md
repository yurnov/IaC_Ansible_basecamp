## Prerequisites

- 4 linux machines (VMs, instances in Digital Ocean, GCP, AWS EC2, dosen't matter);
- Python installed (2.7 or 3.5+);
- established password-less connection from one machine (controller) to others;

ps: one of machine (controller) can be a Windows 10 machine with WSL/WSL2

## Task

* Create a inventory file with four groups, each provisioning VM should be in separate group and group named `iaas` what should include childrens from two first groups;
* Create reusable roles for that:
- creating a empty file `/etc/iaac` with rigths `0500`  
- fetch a linux distro name/version  
* Create playbook for:
- invoke the role for `/etc/iaac` for hosts group `iaas`
- invoke the role for defining variable for all hosts
- print in registered variables
- printing hostnames together with registered variables will be a plus.
* Create a repo in your GitHub account and commit code above

Optional:

- use `ansible_user` and `ansible_password` for ssh connection and store passwords for each VM in encrypred way (add vault password to README.md in this case)
